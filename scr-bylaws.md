# Summary
This document describes the bylaws of the Sabayon Community Repositories Developers group, its mission, and duties.

# Bylaws
The bylaws are written to be consistent with the mission of the SCRDs and to ensure that SCRDs continue to be a SCR Developer in the future. They are also written with the intent to keep the SCR organization a thriving one to fulfill it’s purpose.

# Mission

The Sabayon Community Repositories Developers Team (SCRDs) serve the following purposes:

* Maintain the “community” repository  as an intermediary between Sabayon Linux’s official repositories and the unsupported package collection in the SCR.
* Maintain, manage, and watch over the operation of the SCR.
* Ensure that there isn’t any kind of abuse of SCR infrastructure and services.
* Ensure that packages in SCR are not available in Sabayon repositories nor can be added to it. This means that it is a violation to compile packages that could be in Entropy and are in Portage already. Packages that can be found in Portage have to be found in Entropy, with some exceptions.
* Ensure that no build definition  that could stay in community are not in the “for-gentoo” and “sabayon-distro” overlay, e.g.  package foo, which is NOT in Portage is in Sabayon main repositories (excluding, internal packages which are in the “sabayon-distro” overlay).
* They maintain popular packages (communicating with and sending patches upstream as needed), and vote in administrative matters.
